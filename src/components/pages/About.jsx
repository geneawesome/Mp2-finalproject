    <p>I am Eugene Anthony T. Columna I am from Santa Maria Lal-lo Cagayan and currently residing in Caloocan City. I graduated at Saint Paul University of the Philippines with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering last January 2021. I am good in sports too like tennis and basketball and also, I am good listener and take criticism seriously. I love and enjoy serving people and I am also part of the Student Council in my college days as  a Auditor where in it prepared me to where I am now. I really love joining trainings and seminars where I learn how to stay connected with my fellow officers and It helps me to develop and learn new skills with them. I don't have my actual internship due to pandemic due to pandemic so our dean and adviser offer us to do a project for we can focus on our thesis which is also the project we did on our internship. I learn how to work independently and also in team environment..</p>
